  <p>I recently saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0CVCcb0RJM">this video</a> on my YouTube landing page: some junior developer decided he would reimplement Shazam to keep his days and add to his portfolio, busy since he can&rsquo;t land a job. I decided I&rsquo;d do it too, without looking at the video. After a few unsuccessful attemps, I gave up: I watched the video and read about the general algorithm ideas in a few different places. That guy&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/cgzirim/seek-tune?tab=readme-ov-file">implementation</a> is extremely cool, and definitely more complete than mine, it is a fully-featured (almost) deployment-ready piece of software.
But I&rsquo;m not trying to make any money out of this, I just want to understand how Shazam works: let&rsquo;s code Shazam in about 100 lines of Python.</p>
<p>The teasing: It will be able to extremely confidently recognize songs from such samples, among ~100 songs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><audio controls preload="auto" src="/audios/noisy_cafe_crazy_in_love.wav"></audio>
<audio controls preload="auto" src="/audios/noisy_toxic.wav"></audio></p>
<h1 id="a-physics-crashcourse-a-lie-and-a-promise">A physics crashcourse, a lie and a promise</h1>
<p>Our goal is to design a fingerprinting algorithm for songs, so that even from an extremely partial and noisy sample from the song, we may recognize parts of its unique fingerprint and match it to the right song in our database. To design such a thing, we need to understand what is a <code>.wav</code> or <code>.mp3</code> file in a computer, and this is actually closely related to what &ldquo;sound&rdquo; means in physics.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-sound-really-">What&rsquo;s a sound, really ?</h2>
<p>Wikipedia states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid. In human physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain. Only acoustic waves that have frequencies lying between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz, the audio frequency range, elicit an auditory percept Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and are not audible to humans. Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound. Different animal species have varying hearing ranges, allowing some to even hear ultrasounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What matters in that paragraph is that our human ears hear sounds by sensing variations of the air pressure. In Audacity (a free software for editing audio files), when you open a file, you may visualize it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://manual.audacityteam.org/m/images/b/b7/multi_view_mono_default_50_50.png" alt="Soundwave and spectrogram"></p>
<p>In the top part, a fairly familiar sight: the x-axis is time and the y-axis is the amplitude, i.e the pressure. As we just said, what really matters is the variation of that amplitude, so when we&rsquo;re recording a sound numerically, we need to sample the air pressure very very often. Wikipedia states that we can hear sounds up to 20kHz, so we need atleast 20 000 samples per second ! Actually, to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem">aliasing</a> it is better to have atleast twice that, i.e 40kHz. In a computer, if we ignore compression to save memory, a sound will be represented as a header with some metadata (notably the duration, the sample rate and the number of channels) and then a big list of all these samples. This is exactly how the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV"><code>.wav</code> file format</a> is designed.</p>
<p>Back to that image: in the bottom part, we see something completely different. The x-axis is still time, and the color is the intensity of the sound at a given time, but then what&rsquo;s the  y-axis ? The answer is frequency, in this case it seems to be varying between 0 and 12kHz, with most signal being below 2.6kHz. As I am more a mathemacian than a physicist, I understand this through the following theorem from Fourier analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ smooth enough ($\mathcal{C}^1$ is enough for instance) and $1$-periodic, there exists a unique sequence $(a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ such that </p>
$$f(x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} a_n e^{2 i \pi n x}$$<p>
Moreover the coefficients $a_n$, called the frequencies composing $f$, can be retrieved through the formula </p>
$$a_n = \int_0^1 f(x) e^{-2i \pi nx} \mathrm{d}x$$</blockquote>
<p>The second part of that statement is easy to deduce from the first, by swapping both integrals and using the identity $\int_0^1 e^{2 i \pi n x} = 0$ whenever $n \neq 0$. The first part requires some work and I we will not go down this rabbithole. Going back to the physics, if we think of $f$ as representing a sound (that is the air pressure as a function of the time), we see that any (periodic, it will matter later) sound can be decomposed as a sum of pure trigonometric waves. Pure sin/cosine soundwaves are called pure tones in music, and they sound exactly like when you hit a single note on a piano.</p>
<h2 id="the-infamous-fft">The infamous FFT</h2>
<p>Leaving the physicist realm, we go back to our computers: given an audio file, we need a way to go from the amplitude representation to the frequency representation. The above theorem (up to discretization, i.e replacing integrals by sums over the points of the sampling grid), this amounts to computing enough fourier transforms, that is the above integrals <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, which is about <code>2 * SAMPLE_RATE ^2 * DURATION_IN_SECONDS</code> operations. Even at the extremely low <code>SAMPLE_RATE = 12_000</code> for a 3 min audio, we would need 25 920 000 000 operations. Luckily for us, there is a clever algorithm designed in a divide-and-conqueer fashion that speeds up this process significantly and runs in quasi-linear time: the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). For a fairly clear explanation of the algorithm, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm#The_radix-2_DIT_case">this wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="spectrograms">Spectrograms</h2>
<p>I actually put something under the rug earlier, when I talked about that frequency sound representation (which is called a <em>spectrogram</em> btw). We have a tool (the Fourier transform) to extract frequencies from a sound, but how do we extract frequencies for a sound.. at a given time $t_0$. It turns out we cannot do that, so we do the next best thing: we pick a very small window $[t_0 - \varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon]$ and use the Fourier Transform to extract the frequencies of that new sound. Sadly, Fourier transform is designed to work on periodic signal and there is no reason to believe that sound will be periodic. The discontinuities at the edges introduce aliasing defects, and to avoid that we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function">smoothing window function</a> $\omega(t)$ that is supported on $[t_0 - \varepsilon, t_0 + \varepsilon]$ and zero elsewhere, and we take the Fourier transform of the sound multiplied by this window function over a larger time frame. This avoids aliasing almost completely, at the expense of introducing parasite frequencies that comes from the window function.</p>
<h2 id="listing-the-dependencies">Listing the dependencies</h2>
<p>In essence, the algorithm is fairly easy to map into pure, clean and simple Python, but it will never be fast enough for comfortable use. I wanted to be able to quickly iterate over changes and waiting 20 secondes every time I need the frequency representation of my 3 minute audio was not an option, so I used the <a href="https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html">librosa</a> library in Python. Similarly, Audio files I/O is also handled by librosa, even though <code>.wav</code> is fairly easy and I could have just parsed it by hand. For speed, comfort and many other very good reasons, I also use <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, we are set up, no more new specific theory, no more dependencies. The rest is really about 100 line of codes of pure Python, and a working reasonable proof-of-concept Shazam clone that works reasonably fast with very good noise and distortion resistance (see below for some tests). No magic theorem or unknown data structure, that&rsquo;s a promise !</p>
<h1 id="the-strategy">The strategy</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a rough outline of we will do for each audio we want to be able to recognize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preprocess our audio: resample it to a fixed sample rate, average across channels to transform stereo signals to mono</li>
<li>Apply the procedure explained above to get a spectrogram out of our signal</li>
<li>Split the spectrogram into a few frequency bands (pretty much given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave">octaves</a>)</li>
<li>For each of these bands, store the local magnitude peaks in a big database, that is store triples <code>(peak_frequency, sample_index, music_name)</code>. We&rsquo;ll make the meaning of &ldquo;local magnitude peak&rdquo; more precise below, but you can think of it as &ldquo;the fundamental note played at a given moment in a given octave&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, when we&rsquo;re querying the database with a given noisy recording, we apply the same steps but instead of storing the peaks in the database, we collect all the matching peak_frequencies in the database and then we compare the sample indexes of the matches against the sample indexes of the noisy recording. If there is enough match for a given song and they are coherent in timing, then we found a very likely match.</p>
<h1 id="the-data">The data</h1>
<p>I used the yt-dlp library/command-line tool to download a few famous musical <code>.wav</code> files from YouTube and put them in a <code>audios/</code> folder at the root of the project. The list is composed of about 100 very famous songs ChatGPT put together + 3 randoms songs I added in there (can you find them ?). Note that I downloaded everything as <code>.wav</code> files because I wanted everything to be as simple as possible, but in real life you would definitely use <code>.mp3</code> files.</p>

<p>For benchmarking, I also recorded with my phone in noisy environments/squashed together through scripting and audacity diverses kind of noisy recordings, either by adding a noisy cafe environment, adding gaussian noise or recording over with my phone and talking over it. All of these got recognized by the algorithm, needing at most 20 seconds of recording for the most noisy environments (approx. signal to noise ratio equal to 1).</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s implement that line by line. For the database we use a <code>collections.defaultdict</code>, which is simply a hashmap with a default value in case the key does not exist. In this case, the default value is an empty list.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There&rsquo;s actually <em>lot</em> happening here, so let&rsquo;s go through the parameters one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li>We load the audio by giving its path to librosa</li>
<li>We force librosa to resample<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> it to the given <code>SAMPLE_RATE</code> constant. The reason we resample is 1) we want all our audios to have the same frequency bands and 2) to reduce the computational load 3) the main melodic frequencies lie below 4kHz, so we don&rsquo;t need more than twice the samples per seconds to hear them without aliasing. YouTube audios have a default sample rate of 44kHz, definitely too much for signal analysis. We set <code>SAMPLE_RATE = 8_000</code>. There will be a lot of tunable constants like these along the way so we&rsquo;ll add them one after another at the beginning of the file.</li>
<li>We ask it to give a mono (i.e 1-dimensional, as opposed to hearing different things in both ears when you wear headphones for instance). This is simply done by averaging over all the channels.</li>
<li>Finally, we ask for our signal to be read as 32bit floating points numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second argument we ignore with <code>_</code> is the sample rate, which is useful if you let the <code>sr</code> parameter unspecified and work with files comeing with distinct sample rates: not our case.</p>
<p>Next, we need the spectrogram of our signal. As explained above, we need to take the fft of our signal   times a smoothing function supported on a small subset. We could define such a function like this, with <code>fft</code> being some function yet to be defined</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">build_spectrogram</span>(audio, window_size, hop_length, smoothing_window):

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Nice thing with librosa is there is already a function that builds a spectrogram out of our audio, so that we don&rsquo;t have to handle the sliding window ourselves (and make it a speed bottleneck). It is called <code>stft</code> for Short-Time Fourier Transform</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>spectrogram <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> np<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>abs(librosa<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>stft(audio, n_fft<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>WINDOW_SIZE, hop_length<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>HOP_LENGTH, window<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;hamming&#34;</span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>For the constants, we set <code>WINDOW_SIZE = 2048, HOP_LENGTH = 256</code> which are approximately equal to <code>250ms</code> and <code>25ms</code>, given a sampling_rate of <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>window=&quot;hamming&quot;</code> parameter tells librosa to use a Hamming smoothing window function. Why this function and not another one  ? It seems to be the one that better preserves peak frequencies. I checked that by drawing the spectrograms of a few sums of sinusoids with matplotlib.</p>
<p>TODO add proper link to image
<img src="hamming_window.png" alt="A hamming window function"></p>
<p>The spectrogram here is <code>(1025, len(audio) // WINDOW_SIZE)</code>-shaped, because on a <code>2048</code>-long signal we can&rsquo;t expect to read anything more than the `1025</p>

<p>Downsampling by an integer factor of $k$ should be easy: keep samples that are at indexes a multiple of $k$. Sadly, this introduce aliasing so we need to first filter higher frequencies before doing that, by applying a low-pass filter. Nothing unmanageable, but since this is all done by librosa automatically, we don&rsquo;t need to be concerned with that.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
