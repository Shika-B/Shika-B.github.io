      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently saw &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0CVCcb0RJM&#34;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; on my YouTube landing page: some junior developer decided he would reimplement Shazam to keep his days and add to his portfolio, busy since he can&amp;rsquo;t land a job. I decided I&amp;rsquo;d do it too, without looking at the video. After a few unsuccessful attemps, I gave up: I watched the video and read about the general algorithm ideas in a few different places. That guy &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cgzirim/seek-tune?tab=readme-ov-file&#34;&gt;implementation&lt;/a&gt; is extremely cool, and definitely more complete than mine, it is a fully-featured (almost) deployment-ready piece of software.&#xA;But I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to make any money out of this, I just want to understand how Shazam works, as it is pretty clear that must be a wonderful piece of engineering: let&amp;rsquo;s code Shazam in about 100 lines of Python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
