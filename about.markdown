Hey ! I'm Shika, a 17yo french student interested in Mathematics and Computer Science.
My main interests in Mathematics are Algebraic Topology, Logic and Algebra. In Computer Science I'm particularly interested about creation of programming languages and the different theories behind it (Automata Theory, Type Theory etc.).
