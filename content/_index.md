# About
Hey!

This blog is about reinventing the wheel and writing about it anyway. I believe that re-deriving ideas from scratch is one of the best ways to actually understand them, so that’s what you’ll mostly find here.

My technical interests are in Computer Science and Applied/Pure Mathematics. I’m currently a master’s student in mathematics at ENS Ulm in Paris, where I oscillate between abstract theory and computational thinking.

I go by “Shika” online. This blog is a mix of notes, explanations, and half-baked ideas, written primarily for myself, but hopefully useful to others as well.
